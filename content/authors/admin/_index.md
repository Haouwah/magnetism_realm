Hi, I’m Hauwa Adedo — a materials science researcher exploring magnetism and phase transitions in Heusler alloys. I work with techniques like arc melting, XRD, SEM, and magnetometry to understand how structure and magnetism interact in smart materials. My current focus is on Fe- and Cu-doped Ni₂MnGa systems, with an eye toward applications like magnetic refrigeration. I’m passionate about turning complex data into clear, compelling science.
